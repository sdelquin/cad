# CAD

My projects on 3D. Models from Autodesk Fusion 360.

## Adding a new design

1. Create a new subfolder inside the `designs` folder.
2. Copy `render.png` with the renderized image of the design.
3. Copy `drawing.pdf` with the dimensioned image of the design.
4. Run `build.sh` to add the new design.

> `index.html` would have the definitive version of the page.
